#Shower with Alexa

###Intro:
Many great thoughts were developed during the shower time. However, there are also many of them got forgotten because the person stop thinking about it after the shower. My idea is try to help record down the precious shower thoughts and with the Alexa’s help we can bootstrap and solidify the abstract shower thought into something real and practical.

Moreover, we can use shower-with-alexa to do many different things efficiently during shower time.

In conclude, this skill/app for Alexa will be your shower assistant and it will do things for you during shower time. No more potential water damages to your mobile devices.


Some use cases:

if { user only do “ask shower thought” } then { Welcome msg: “Hi Baron, What can I do for you today!” }
IF   - User command = > Step 1 : “Alexa, put me in Shower mode” / “Alexa, I have a great idea” / “Alexa, help me record this thought”
THEN -   Alexa response = > Ans 1:   “Sure, tell me about it, Baron!”
IF   - ….
THEN -  Alexa response = > Ans 2:   “Is that all? That seems like a great idea, I’ve recorded down and send it to your phone/email.”
IF   - User command = > Step 2 : “Alexa, how far is it from here to SFO?”
THEN - Alexa response = > Ans 3:   “Redirecting to google map” => “It is 35 minutes driving distance away from your location.”
